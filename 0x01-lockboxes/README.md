# Lockboxes Puzzle Solver

This Python script solves the Lockboxes puzzle, which is a problem where you have a set of locked boxes, each containing keys to other boxes. The goal is to determine if it's possible to unlock all the boxes starting with the first unlocked box (box 0).

## Problem Description

You are given `n` number of locked boxes, each numbered sequentially from 0 to `n - 1`. Each box may contain keys to the other boxes. A key with the same number as a box can open that box. You can assume the following:

-   All keys will be positive integers.
-   There can be keys that do not have boxes.
-   The first box, `boxes[0]`, is unlocked.

The task is to implement a method, `canUnlockAll(boxes)`, which determines if all the boxes can be opened, and returns `True` if they can, or `False` otherwise.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `0-lockboxes.py` script.

2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

3. Run the script with your input or use the provided test cases as examples:

    ```python
    python 0-lockboxes.py
    ```

The script will output True if all boxes can be opened, or False otherwise, based on the input provided.

## Implementation Details

The script uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the graph formed by the keys and boxes. It starts with the first unlocked box (box 0) and iteratively visits all boxes that can be opened from the current box, marking them as visited. The process continues until all reachable boxes have been visited or until it's determined that not all boxes can be opened.

### Examples

#### Example Input #1 (True)

Here are some example test cases:

python
Copy code
boxes1 = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes1)) # True

boxes2 = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes2)) # True

boxes3 = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes3)) # False
