# Minimum Operations to Obtain 'H' Characters

This Python script calculates the fewest number of operations required to obtain a specific number of 'H' characters in a text file. The only allowed operations are "Copy All" and "Paste."

## Usage

1. Import the `minOperations` function from the `0-minoperations` module.

2. Call the `minOperations` function with the desired number of 'H' characters as the argument. It will return the minimum number of operations needed to achieve that count.

3. The script will return `0` if it's impossible to obtain the desired number of 'H' characters.

## Example

```python
from 0-minoperations import minOperations

n = 9
operations = minOperations(n)
print(f"Min # of operations to reach {n} char: {operations}")

```

## Algorithm Explanation

The script uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the fewest number of operations. It starts with one 'H' character in the file and iteratively checks if it can copy and paste to reach the target number of 'H' characters, updating the count of operations accordingly.

## Test Cases

You can test the script using the provided test cases in the 0-main.py file.
