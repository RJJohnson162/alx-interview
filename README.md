# Pascals triangle

Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical pattern or triangular array of numbers named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although it was known to Chinese mathematicians over 500 years before Pascal's time. It has many fascinating properties and applications in various areas of mathematics and beyond.

## Pascal's Triangle is constructed as follows:

The first row consists of a single number, which is 1.
Each subsequent row starts and ends with the number 1.
The numbers in between are obtained by adding the two numbers directly above them in the previous row.
Here is an example of the first few rows of Pascal's Triangle:

       1
      1 1
     1 2 1
    1 3 3 1

1 4 6 4 1
1 5 10 10 5 1
Each row represents a sequence of numbers, with the first row being "1," the second row being "1 1," the third row being "1 2 1," and so on. These numbers are known as binomial coefficients and have numerous applications in combinatorics, probability, algebra, and calculus.

## Pascal's Triangle has several interesting properties, such as:

The sum of the numbers in each row is a power of 2 (2^n, where n is the row number).
The diagonal elements of the triangle are all 1.
The numbers in Pascal's Triangle have connections to combinations and the expansion of binomial expressions.
Pascal's Triangle is widely used in mathematics, especially in combinatorics, probability theory, and algebra, to solve problems related to counting, combinations, and more. It also has applications in computer science, particularly in algorithms and programming involving combinations and permutations.
